## My process

### Built with

- Vue.js
- Quasar
- Pinia
- Vite
- Express.js
- MongoDB

### What I learned
This enitre app is a learning project, to learn the Quasar framework. At one point, I was trying to flesh out the tool to potentially advocate for using it as a replacement frontend library. When it was decided my previous organization would not be changing their stack, I continued development on the appliction because I had a great devloper expereince using Vue3 and Quasar.
I learned a lot about the Quasar framework and it's built in features. I really enjoy the easy to implement error handling and theme customizations.
I also learned about Pinia, the new recommened state management solution for Vue3. Boy oh boy, it is so nice to work with. Goodbye mutations! Hello seemless reactivity and painless state management.


### Continued development
In the future, I would love to extend the drag and drop functionality to include reordering task within their columns. I think this would make the application feel really nice to work with. I would also like to beef up the typescript usage, and testing coverage.
Another feature that this application needs is user setting configurations.
